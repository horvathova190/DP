This tool is based on Master's thesis: Creating of River Cross Profiles from Lidar Data. It integrates LAS files and vector files containing river data (line features) to generate 
cross-sectional profiles at specified intervals. These profiles are exported as PNG image files and displayed alongside a terrain map preview. 
It's  designed for QGIS (3.32 and later). For running you also need plugins - Sagang and Lastools. 
Outputs of this tool are multiple and all od them are supposed to save to folder you choose. These outputs are - merged (if you have multiple files in folder) and filtered point cloud,
digital terrain model, two sets of profile layers, profiles and map preview. 

You can see a test run of the tool on this video:
